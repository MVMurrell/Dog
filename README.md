## Description

For our final project we built a matching application called "Doggle". This website lets you match your dog with other dogs for friendship, playdates, and more. This is a unique spin on the now ubiquitous dating app.

Our website allows you to register, set up an account, add dogs to your profile, and then "swipe" on dogs you like or dislike, allowing you to message them if you both like each other.

There is also an admin role that allows you to edit or delete profiles/dogs/messages even if they don't belong to you. This role can also view metrics and statistics on the activity of users.
