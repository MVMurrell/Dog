## Description

For our final project we built a matching application called "Doggle". This website lets you match your dog with other dogs for friendship, playdates, and more. This is a unique spin on the now ubiquitous dating app.

Our website allows you to register, set up an account, add dogs to your profile, and then "swipe" on dogs you like or dislike, allowing you to message them if you both like each other.

There is also an admin role that allows you to edit or delete profiles/dogs/messages even if they don't belong to you. This role can also view metrics and statistics on the activity of users.

## How to use
1) To begin using Doggle, first you must register. Click the "Register" button in the middle of the home screen. This will bring you to registration.
2) Once you've made it to the registration screen enter your information along with your dogs information.
3) After you register your dog, you will be able to beginning liking or disliking dogs. To like a dog press "like", to dislike a dog press "nope". To see more information on a dog press "See Profile".
3) To see your personal profile click "profile" in the navigation bar. You are the only one who can see your profile. While viewing your profile you can edit your information or delete your account. After your account is deleted only the Admin can reactivate your account.
4) While in your profile view your can also view your dog's profile that other dog owner's see and also edit their profile and preference. If you edit their preferences, you will only be shown dogs that fit that criteria to like or dislike. You can also deactivate your dog if your dog needs a break from dating.
5) If you like a dog that likes you, an alert will pop up letting you know there is a match. To begin chatting with your match, press the "go to profile" button in the pop up, click the message dock at the bottom right hand part of the dogs profile and begin setting up doggy dates! If you don't want to go to the dog's profile then press the "x" and continue swiping.
6) When you're finished, you can find the logout button at the top right hand part of the screen in the navigation bar.
7) Now you know how to use Doggle!
